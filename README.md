Problem statement:

COVID-19 infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has widely spread all over the world. We want to do an experimental project on Covid-19 image classification and test the hypothesis of automated detection of covid-19 using X-ray images.

With enough annotated images, deep learning approaches have demonstrated their superiority over the classifying images. CNN architecture is one of the most popular deep learning approaches with superior achievements in the medical imaging domain. 	

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with the symptoms of pneumonia, which can be revealed by X-ray images. We intend to use CNN to detect X-ray images with covid-19.
